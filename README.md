# Spring
 All Spring Projects (foundation and sample)

Basically this is collection of the all the hands on practice Spring Projects I have tried working on 
through the the duration of 6th October, 2024 & onwards.


The Spring Boot Rest Project has been updated with the Spring Boot Jpa, which means that the Job Portal Application 
has been redesigned using Rest Api Controllers and then linked with Spring Jpa Repository so as to connect it with
the Postgres Sql DataBase.


This Spring Repository is subject continuous updation as when I keep developing hands on Project so as to
get to a depth of understanding with the Spring and the Spring Boot Framework.
